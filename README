Steps for new posts:
1) create a new md file at content/post, ex:
   $ vi content/post/new_test.md
   
   Example of header in that file:

   +++
   title = "New_test"
   date  = "2019-01-03"
   slug  = "2019/01/03/new_test"
   +++

2) Run hugo to create static site in ./philtomson.github.com directory here:
   $ hugo
   
   To optionally test:
   $ hugo server -D

   then open http:/localhost:1313

3) To deploy:

   $ cd philtomson.github.com
   $ git status #check to see that things have changed
   $ git commit -am "some commit message"
   $ git push origin master

   Now you should see your changes at http//philtomson.github.com within about 5 minutes

TODO: 
   the problem now is that the source posts are not under git so we need to create 
   another repo on gitub for this and make philtomson.github.com a submodule
   of that one.
